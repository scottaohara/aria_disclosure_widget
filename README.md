# ARIA Disclosure Widgets  

A disclosure widget consists of a button that toggles the state of its associated content to be expanded or collapsed. 


## How does it work?  
Check out the [demo page](https://scottaohara.github.io/aria_disclosure_widget/) for markup patterns and variations.  

Some more work needs to be done here, maybe I'll do that at some point.
